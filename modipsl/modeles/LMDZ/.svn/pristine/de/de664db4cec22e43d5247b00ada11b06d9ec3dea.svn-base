!     The array SELFREFO contains the coefficient of the water vapor
!     self-continuum (including the energy term).  The first index
!     refers to temperature in 7.2 degree increments.  For instance,
!     JT = 1 refers to a temperature of 245.6, JT = 2 refers to 252.8,
!     etc.  The second index runs over the g-channel (1 to 16).
